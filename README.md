# Kit's Architecture 
## Introduction: 
  
   When migrating to a new package dependency manager in Xcode, there are several challenges that developers may face. This documentation          outlines some of the potential issues, the stuggles we face during the development for mitigating them, In addition to the initiatives we        have taken to address the specific issues, there are other measures we can consider to further resolve the situation.

## Challenges:

  The new package manager may not be compatible with all of the existing dependencies in the project. This can lead to build errors and           other issues. one of the main challenges is ensuring compatibility with existing dependencies. The new package manager may have different       requirements or limitations compared to the old one, which can lead to build errors or other issues. In some cases, the existing                 dependencies may need to be updated or replaced to work with the new package manager. Additionally, it's important to consider the               compatibility of the new package manager with other tools and systems used in the project, such as continuous integration and  deployment       pipelines. Careful review and testing of compatibility issues can help ensure a smooth migration process and minimize potential disruptions     to the development workflow.
    
## Performance issues:

  Depending on the new package manager, performance may be impacted during the migration process. This can be particularly problematic if the     project requires fast and efficient package management.
  Mitigation: Before migrating, developers should carefully review the performance characteristics of the new package manager and ensure that     it meets the project's requirements. Performance testing should also be performed during the migration process to identify any potential         issues.
        
## Dependency conflicts: 

  Configuring the new package manager can be complex and time-consuming, particularly if the project has many dependencies or requires a lot       of customization. Before migrating, developers should carefully plan the configuration process and consider automating certain aspects of       the setup. This can help reduce the potential for errors and inconsistencies. Different packages may have conflicting dependencies, which       can cause errors or unexpected behavior when migrating to a new package manager. This can be particularly challenging to resolve if the new     package manager has different rules for resolving conflicts than the old one.

   - When using a kit's architecture-related dependency, it is important to note that only the kit should be consumed and module usage should        be prohibited. This means that any external code using the kit should only access the kit's public interface and not directly interact          with its internal modules or implementation details.

## Mitigation: 

  Before migrating, developers should carefully review the compatibility of the new package manager with the existing dependencies. In             some cases, it may be necessary to update or replace certain dependencies to ensure compatibility. Providing training and resources to the       development team can help ease the transition and ensure that everyone is comfortable with the new package manager.
  Providing training and resources to the development team can help ease the transition and ensure that everyone is comfortable with the new       package manager. This may include training sessions, documentation, and online resources. Additionally, gradually transitioning to the new       package manager can help developers learn and adjust without becoming overwhelmed. Finally, providing support and encouragement to the           development team during the learning process can help reduce frustration and promote a positive attitude towards the new package manager.

## Learning curve: 

  Migrating to a new package dependency manager can require developers to learn new tools, workflows, and terminology. This learning curve         can be challenging and time-consuming, particularly for developers who are used to the old package manager. Some specific challenges of the     learning curve include:

   - Familiarity: Developers may be accustomed to the features and interface of the old package manager, making it difficult to adjust to a         new one.

   - Differences in syntax: Different package managers may use different syntax for commands and configuration files, which can be confusing         for developers who are used to the old syntax.

   - New workflows: The new package manager may require different workflows for managing dependencies, which can take time for developers to         learn and adapt to.

   Migrating to a new package dependency manager in Xcode can be challenging, but with careful planning and testing, many of these challenges      can be mitigated. By reviewing compatibility, providing training, automating configuration, resolving dependency conflicts, and testing          performance, developers can ensure a smooth transition to the new package manager.

## Package Setup

### Adding the dependency

Adding kits in package dependency:
``` swift
// MARK: - Products 
var products: [Product] = [
    .library(name: "AuthKit", targets: ["AuthKit"]),
```
dependencies:
``` swift 
// MARK: - Dependencies
var dependencies: [PackageDescription.Package.Dependency] = [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/marmelroy/PhoneNumberKit.git", .upToNextMajor(from: .init(3, 3, 3))),
```
Targets:
``` swift 
// MARK: - Targets
var targets: [Target] = [
    .target(
        name: "AuthKit",
        dependencies: [
            "KeychainAccess",
            .product(name: "CommonInterfaceModule", package: "IOS-Common-Interface"),
            .product(name: "NetworkKit", package: "IOS-Base-Kit"),
            .product(name: "AnywhereSerializationKit", package: "IOS-Core-Kit"),
            .product(name: "AnywhereLoggerKit", package: "IOS-Core-Kit")
        ],
        path: "Sources/AuthKit",
        plugins: packagePlugins
    ),
  ]
```
Note : When using a kit's architecture-related dependency, it's crucial to only consume the kit and prohibit module usage. This means that external code should only access the kit's public interface and not interact with its internal modules. This approach promotes better code organization, encapsulation, and easier maintenance.
